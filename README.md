# a_random_quote_generator-v1
## Introduction
Treehouse Unit 1 Project. This application presents a random quote generated from a hard-coded array of objects, at a set interval. There's also a button to show a random quote from the array.

## Tech Stack
HTML/CSS. JavaScript.

## Process/Learning
This was the first time I used Git version control, and published a repository. This also helped me understand the basics of JavaScript being used on the front-end by using DOM manipulation. The project also helped me understand how to create and use functions, while keepig hoisting in mind.

## Improvement
The web page is incredibly basic, as it was the first project of the Treehouse FSJS coding bootcamp. There can be a number of improvements such as removing the hard-coded quotes and using a Fetch API to retrieve a larger number/variety of quotes. The page can be styled better, such as making the "Show another quote" a fixed color/style so that it doesn't blend in with the page. Also, the setInterval should reset its timer if the "Show another quote" button is clicked.

## Running the Project
Clone the project, and simply open ```index.html```
<br /> Otherwise, I have a live version [here](https://crooks-s.github.io/a_random_quote_generator-v1/).
